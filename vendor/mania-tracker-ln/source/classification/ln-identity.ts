/**
 * The rating tiebreak on 4K LN identity.
 *
 * Structure decides identity first (dan-estimator/ln-effective.ts). A chart
 * past the 45% hold line whose section shares fall short can still be LN
 * when its LN work is the harder half: the independent LN rating at least
 * LN_RATING_IDENTITY_MARGIN above native Overall at the same rate.
 *
 * Why a rating and not another structural reading (2026-09-18): a 160 bpm
 * chart of 1/4 and 1/2 holds with 1/4 same-lane gaps, half inverse and half
 * minijacks under a held note, is LN at 1.5x to anyone who plays it, while
 * a 1/4-held jumpstream chart and a full-LN roll at the same rate play as
 * jumpstream. Every structural number (long share, chain share, notes
 * under an active hold, occupancy) puts the first chart at or below the
 * other two; only the ratings order them (+3.0 against -0.2 and -5.0 then,
 * +7.5 against +5.1 and +1.8 on the score-fitted LN scale). Since the tap
 * gate (LN_TRACKED_MIN_SHARE) the other two stay rice before the rating is
 * read, as does any chart whose holds are tapped through, one whose
 * heaviest sections pin no finger (LN_HELD_PEAK_QUANTILE), and one that
 * only same-lane chains lift past the tap gate while its hardest stretches
 * hold nothing through other presses (LN_HELD_THROUGH_MIN_SHARE).
 *
 * The stored `lnEffectiveRatio` is lifted to the identity line so the one
 * stored share keeps answering every consumer; `lnStructuralRatio` keeps the
 * measured number and `lnRatingIdentity` says the rating decided.
 */
export const LN_RATING_IDENTITY_MARGIN = 1;

/**
 * The chain exemption lifts the tap gate on a chart whose chained short
 * holds are a tenth of its notes (dan-estimator/ln-effective.ts), and the
 * rating then prices every one of those holds. On a jumpstream written in
 * holds, each held until the next row's press, that read 6 points over
 * Overall at 1.5x on a chart labeled fast jumpstream. What the chains
 * labeled LN have and that chart lacks is a finger held down while the other
 * columns press on two or more separate rows.
 *
 * Read on the hardest fifth of the chart's 2s windows (by the workload's
 * demand), as a share of their notes, since a hybrid's LN sits in its
 * hardest stretches and its rice elsewhere dilutes a whole-chart share. A
 * chart under the tap line whose share is under LN_HELD_THROUGH_MIN_SHARE
 * stays rice, however its rating compares to Overall.
 *
 * Fitted 2026-10-03 on hand-labeled charts. Among the charts only chains lift
 * past the tap line, the rice labels read 0.000 to 0.018 and the LN labels
 * 0.026 and up; charts past the tap line (holds a tap cannot release, 0.10+)
 * are untouched, so slow hold-and-release charts and LN walls whose holds
 * span one press row stay LN. Over the cached 4K charts it returns 23 of 662
 * tiebreak LN verdicts to rice, and no labeled LN play.
