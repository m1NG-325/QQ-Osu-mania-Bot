/**
 * Effective LN share: how much of a chart actually demands a release.
 *
 * A hold is effective when its played body outlasts the OD's release 300
 * window ("long"), or when it sits in a recurring same-lane release/repress
 * chain ("chained": two or more links, bodies within 20ms of the window or
 * longer, tail-to-next-head gaps from 0 to the window). A lone pair, a tiny
 * body or another column's head inside the body is not enough. Durations and
 * gaps are measured at the played rate, exactly once.
 *
 * Identity reads each 10s window: LN when 40% of its notes are long holds, or
 * when 60% are release work of either kind (an inverse chart at 264 bpm writes
 * 57ms bodies under a 63ms window and never has a long hold). The chart's
 * share is the note-weighted median over windows, so it is LN when most of
 * its playtime is: short-LN filler does not dilute real LN sections, and one
 * LN wall does not qualify a rice chart. On 4K this gate follows the 45% hold
 * line; it can demote a nominal LN chart whose tails are free, never promote.
 *
 * Everything here is structural (times, columns, OD); no chart identity.
