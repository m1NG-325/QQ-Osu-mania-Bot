/**
 * The required LN actions of a 4K chart, as strain per 500ms section. Each
 * press and independence task adds one unit of work to its hand, a release a
 * third of one, a jack from a tap up to JACK_UNITS. Only notes, rate and OD
 * enter.
 *
 * Every written hold is priced as a hold, including one a tap would release
 * in time, and a chord costs each finger in it. Measured on same-player
 * scores (2026-09-30; 7,550 players, 218k pairs of 1.0x plays on charts of
 * 75%+ holds, 19.7k pairs at 1.5x, OD held as a covariate), the harder chart
 * of a pair read harder 86.0% of the time at 1.0x and 85.2% at 1.5x, against
 * 82.7% and 66.5% when tap-releasable holds were discounted by that chance
 * and chords were concave, and 85.3% and 80.8% for native Overall. The tap
 * discount read dense short-hold charts as easy, and at 1.5x most of a
 * chart's holds as free. The tap reading still decides identity and the rice
 * share.
 *
 * v15 (2026-10-02) re-measured over every LN-rated chart, not only 75%+ holds:
 * 244k plays, ~1M same-player pairs split by mapset. The jack term and the
 * cheaper releases took ordering from 72.1/77.0% to 77.7/79.7% across the two
 * halves; the Overall blend in ln-skill.ts adds the rest. Reading the
 * same-motion tolerance in chart time scored no better once blended and would
 * rate a rate-mod play apart from the same notes baked into a file.
